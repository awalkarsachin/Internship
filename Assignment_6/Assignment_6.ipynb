       "['We tested the HP OMEN 17 2023 at our digit test labs and it got every single gamer in the Digit editorial team super excited with its screaming fast performance across the latest games at maxed-out settings. Just to give you a reference, the OMEN 17 will happily do 350+ FPS on Valorant and consistently deliver 100+ FPS across any game you throw at it, all with the graphics slider kept at maximum/highest levels. You can check out our video review below to get the full low down on its performance, display quality tests with hardware level tests of brightness and color accuracy along with thermal performance under heavy load as well.',\n",
       " 'This laptop won our best performance award last year in the gaming laptop category and that is a testament to its performance and gaming prowess. What impressed us the most about this gaming beast is its sustained performance delivery even under heavy loads. This speaks volumes about its thermal management system, a big factor when it comes to high-performance gaming laptops that house top-of-the-line hardware inside laptop chassis which have very little room to manage heat in comparison to gaming desktops. However, you should also keep in mind that this is one heavy laptop (3.3 kg) and its not meant to be carried around frequently. The MSI Titan is also heavy on your wallet and that’s also the reason why we have suggested lesser-priced high-performance gaming laptops below in the list to suit slightly lower budgets. To know more about the MSI laptop and its performance numbers, check out our videos below.',\n",
       " 'This Lenovo Legion 5i Pro gaming laptop hits the sweet spot when it comes to the price-to-performance ratio in the upper price range of gaming laptops. It does pack an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070Ti GPU which is very well-fed with enough power. The 150W TGP rating of the GPU ensures unshackled performance across the most demanding games with Ray Tracing turned on. Besides performance (which you can find in detail from the video below), the other two areas that left us mighty impressed are thermal management and display quality. Lenovo has worked on the aspects that matter the most to gamers and as a result, this gaming laptop performs very well when it comes to the premium segment of gaming laptops where there is very little room for any cut corners.',\n",
       " 'If a 17-inch display on a gaming laptop no longer cuts it for you, this one should be right in the slot for a high-performance gaming laptop. With an 18-inch display the ASUS ROG Strix Scar 18 (that’s a mouthful), should be your weapon of choice, especially if you are on the lookout for a performance machine with an Nvidia RTX 4080 under the hood. The blazing fast GPU is well accompanied by a 13th Gen Intel Core i9 HX series processor and 32GB of RAM. Your games will not only run at butter-smooth frame rates, they will also load faster with 32GB of DDR5 memory rated at 4800MHz. The large 18-inch display allowed ASUS some additional room inside the chassis, as a result, while the laptop has a large footprint, it’s not excessively thick or heavy for an 18-inch top specced gaming laptop. Our only possible crib against the laptop is the display resolution which is limited to FHD+ (1920 x 1200) on this particular model. So you will be a bit short of the 1440p standard which is considered as the sweet spot, given the GeForce RTX 4080 under the hood.',\n",
       " 'The Acer Predator series of gaming laptops has impressed us during our testing with its consistent cooling performance and with the brand new Helios Neo line-up Acer has further improved on the thermal management aspect. This particular Neo 16 model combines the latest gaming hardware, with a 13th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card. This combination delivers unbeatable value in the high-performance gaming laptop segment, the Core i7 + RTX 4060 combination fits like a glove for 1440p gaming at high FPS. And Acer has chosen the right display spec with a 165Hz 16-inch IPS display with 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution. And the panel carries an impressive 500nit brightness rating, making it one of the brightest displays in its price segment. We do have a bone to pick with Acer though, 16GB of RAM simply doesn’t do justice to this configuration, this one screams for 32GB RAM to make the most of all the firepower inside that well-built chassis.',\n",
       " 'Another ASUS laptop makes it to our list, and this one lies at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to portability. This is your high-performance “go anywhere” gaming laptop. Asus ROG Zephyrus is known for its thin and light play in the high-performance gaming laptop space and this particular model sits at the top of the stack. ASUS proudly calls this one an “All AMD Muscle” gaming laptop, courtesy of the combination of AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS and the AMD Radeon RX 6700S graphics card with 8GB of GDDR6 video RAM. The combination works really well when it comes to delivering top-notch gaming performance across all AAA gaming titles. The 14-inch display ensures you don’t need to push the resolution beyond 1080p and take full advantage of the 144Hz refresh rate on the display. Besides being a compact, thin, and light gaming laptop, the Zephyrus 14 is also one of the best-looking gaming laptops with excellent build quality. We have tested the Asus ROG Zephyrus series of gaming laptops in the past and have particularly appreciated how it delivers a quality gaming experience in a small package. Creators and gamer streamers should particularly consider this laptop, as this does deliver gaming goods while not bothering you with any additional heft.',\n",
       " 'One of the newest gaming laptop series from MSI, the MSI Cyborg is all about walking the line when it comes to performance vs portability. It does the balancing act by offering a slim chassis that is also light at under 2kg. This particular MSI Cyborg 15 model that we are recommending here runs on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card, coupled with a 10-core 12th Gen Intel Core i7 series processor. The display on this one is a standard 15.6 inch 1080p panel with a 144Hz refresh rate. At a market price of approximately Rs. 1,30,990, this MSI laptop is a value-for-money pick for gamers looking at pure FPS numbers and wanting to go well beyond the entry-level gaming laptops without having to commit a big chunk of their back balance.']"

There is no such source available on earth that can propel a body at infinite speed.

gravitational influence(like going significantly away from a black hole), your time starts getting equal to the time of the world , so everything is revolving around time dilation which deals with
